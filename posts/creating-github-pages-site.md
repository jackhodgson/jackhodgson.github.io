# Some Notes on setting up these pages in Github Pages

Some unstructured notes.

The "homepage" of the site is the repo at \<username\>/\<username\>.github.io
  
  If there was a previous repo using that name, you can simply change the name of the repo.
  
  The homepage will appear at <https://jackhodgson.github.io>
  
  Changes to the pages do not appear instantly. It can take a few minutes for the change to appear on the site.
  
  "sub" pages can be created in lower directories.
  
  In Github, create a folder/directory by clicking "new file"... enter the new FOLDER name followed by a slash... this will generate a folder, and continue typing the name of the first page in the folder.
  
  These sub-folder pages will appear at <https://jackhodgson.github.io/posts> or <https://jackhodgson.github.io/posts/pagethree.html>
  
  Note that source pages written as Markdown .md appear as .html instead of .md.
